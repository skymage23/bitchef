"project.json" schema needs:
source-based-dependencies:
-- -- an attribute to set the "builder".
-- -- -- Said attribute should support string and JSON object values.
-- -- -- -- If object, must inherit from the "Builder" JSON object.
-- -- -- -- If object, must have "type" attribute that accepts a "string" value
-- -- -- -- -- said "string" value must be the name of a library-provided "Builder".

Auto-detection of builder?: Something to add later.
Auto-detection of "sharedlib" project?: 
-- How?: Detection of "project.json", proper project root directories.
-- -- That's all we need. Then, "project.json" needs a "version" attribute.
      Let the initial value be "1.0.0".
     
No, and the reason is that we need to provide the option of incorporating
the subproject fully into the overarching project, or if we need to
keep it wholely separate and build it separately.

We should still have the "version" attribute, though. [Now, we do. It's a "string" value.]
