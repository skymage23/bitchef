The default getter is set by the selected build environment.
By default, UNLESS a "version" map is specified for use by the
getter for installing packages (be it on the "dependency" level
or on the "global" level), the default behavior is to use the following
format string "{$version.major}.{$version.minor}.{$version.revision}"
in attempting to install the package.

You can also override aspects of the "version" attribute in the 
getter definition by using the "version_override" attribute.
-- Attributes of "version_override" can either be numbers or
   a format string.



Use "sharedlib" to construct DarkLight OS?
If we can get it to work, that would be helpful in generating
ISO installer images and SD card images.

Do I need to set up a method to add package management repos?,

We could. What would be the best way?
Hmm. We could define the repos under "getter_global_settings",

Are we getting in over our head with this?


We should definitely rely on "sudo" being present, by default.
If users want to force attempting to run code requiring
root privileges, then they should be able to pass a CLI 
argument to do so, BUT they should be warned somewhere
that the library can fail if it is denied access.

As for the developers, they should code defensively
and never assume they will have root. While they
should try to run code requiring root, they should
be able to gracefully handle being blocked by the OS
due to not having the needed permissions.
