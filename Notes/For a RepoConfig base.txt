For a RepoConfig base object, certain fields are required:
Name
URL
Architecture (class CPUArchitecture(enum.Enum))
Signing key URL (Where to get the signing key for the new Repo).


Package Manager-specific constraints:
APT:
OS-Release (Like, sid, trixie, xenial, sarge, etc.)
Repository (Like, universe, multiverse, non-free, etc.)


A given dependency may have multiple repo configs,
but only 1 per supported package manager is allowed.

Ok. First and foremost, you need to parse the "project.toml" file and
Have a thorough understanding of the object produced(?)
