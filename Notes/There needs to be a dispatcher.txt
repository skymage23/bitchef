There needs to be a dispatcher that reads the test type from the JSON filename and then calls the correct function
to generate the test code.  How is that determined? A function callback table.


Each schema has its own file, and each attribute to be described by the schema has its own class.
Actually, if those attributes have sub-attributes, those are also denoted by their own class.

That means, we need some way of tracing a schema back up to its parent.  This is because, should a
test fail, we want some way to print the lineage of the attribute in question to make it easier for
the programmer to track down and fix the issue.

How can we do this?

We can just make a file-global hashmap that encodes attribute inheritance properties.
